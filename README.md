# Coffee Shop Insights Dashboard 
## Project Objectives 
An interactive Excel dashboard to analyze coffee shop sales and customer trends. It tracks revenue, units sold, average price, hourly demand, weekday ordering patterns, top products, product-category mix, and store-location performance.
## Tech Stack
Microsoft Excel (Power Query, PivotTables, PivotCharts, Slicers, Named Ranges)
## Features
•	KPI Cards: Total revenue, quantity sold, average unit price.
•	Hourly Demand Curve: Quantity ordered by hour (6:00–18:00).
•	Weekday Orders: Orders by day (Mon–Sun).
•	Top Products: Revenue by product (e.g., Barista Espresso, Chai Tea, etc.).
•	Category Mix: Revenue % by product category (Tea, Coffee, Drinking Chocolate, etc.).
•	Store Performance: Revenue share by location (Astoria, Hell’s Kitchen, Lower Manhattan).
•	Slicers/Filters: Store Location and Product Category for cross-filtering every visual.
•	Modern UI: Clean, coffee-themed palette and consistent typography.
## Sample Insights (from the demo)
•	Coffee contributes ~39% of total revenue; Tea ~28%.
•	Astoria and Lower Manhattan each ~33–34% of revenue; Hell’s Kitchen ~33%.
•	Demand peaks between 8–10 AM; Friday shows strong order volume.
•	Barista Espresso is the top-grossing product.
